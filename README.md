#  Battle Golf

A fun sports survival game where you are playing a game of golf after hours. The staff are actively trying to remove you from the course but you're determine
to get the lowest par!

Although, you're playing with a twist. Every time you hit one of the staff with your club you have decided to add 5 shots to your score.
and when you throw any spare golf balls at the staff you gain 1 extra shot.

Dont run out of Stamina now, else you wont make it to the end of the course and you will lose!

Features:
* Use your golf club to play golf and hit the ball ‚õ≥
* Throw your golf club to enemies to knock them out - has to be collected to continue hitting the balls üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Collect spare golf balls to throw at the staff
* If they catch you you should shake them off before your stamina runs out
* Fight your way through rough grass and bunkers that effect the players movement
* Try get the lowest score you can! :moneybag:

## How to Play
* W,A,S,D to move around
* left click to hit ball
* right click to thow club
* scroll wheel (up or down) to change ammo type
* when in range of the ball - click and drag the mouse in the opposite direction to shoot

## Dependencies
* SDL library
* SDL Mixer
* SDL Image
* SDL TTF

## Target platforms
Support Windows x64

Instructions to build on Windows platforms:
1) Load .sln solution with Visual Studio;
2) Select Release configuration, and x64 Architecture;
3) Compile and run the project.

## TODO

* Video playing
* loading screen

## COMPLETE
* A* pathfinding for enemies
* Optimise
* Hitting the golf ball
* Particles
* Collisions - rect & circle
* Loading external files - binary and txt
* Enemy spawn in
* Stamina bar
* Shooting
* Menu / Game Music
* Button SFX
* Main Menu
* lose and win screens
* Tiled Map
* Spritesheet Animations

## code section profiling / memory management
Main Menu loop:<br />
20 - 40ms first run<br />
3-5ms every loop<br/>
* usage of pointers and passing by refrence where possible to reduce copying into functions
* trying to minimise branches where possible to minimise decisions
<br/>

Gameloop = 80 - 90ms every loop (deliberate delay)<br />
gameloop without this takes 3-5ms (desktop)<br />
Main Menu takes 3-9ms (desktop)<br />
Lose Screen takes 5-12ms (laptop)<br />
Win Screen takes 13 -17ms (laptop)<br/>
Update loop for everything  1-3ms (desktop)<br/>

draw loop with 80ms delay 80 - 90ms<br> (biggest cost in the program)<br/>
* improved with textures and GPU acceleration
* this was also done for the particles with a 1 - 3ms loop time <br>

added file loading for my maps this added 3 - 6ms and was moved into the init for start time impact and not during game impact<br/>

Using the CPU usage it is easier to tell where the clock cycles are taking the longest amount of time<br/>
in this case update takes the longest because it calls draw before completing which contains the delay but also contains all the rendering<br/>

2. Percentage of usage based on how long called methods/functions
3. Section of code uder analysis
4. Resources used by the CPU in the time frame
